# SettlersOfCatan
A simulation of Settlers of Catan. It was made for an end-of-the-semester project for our Data Structures class.
It is complete in all respects except that there is no trading or development cards, and players do not lose half their resources on a 7.
Press 1 to build a Road. Press 2 to build a Settlement. Press 3 to build a City. Press 4 to build a development card. Press 5 to trade. The various development cards are played with the Q, W, E, and R buttons. Press Backspace to cancel an action. Press Space to end your turn.

New features that needed to be added:
  2. Adding development cards. Shimmy will be doing most of this, but Aryeh will need to add I/O for interacting with the cards.
  3. Adding trading with the bank.
  4. Adding trading with other players (we will need to have a meeting and discuss how exactly this is supposed to work).
  5. Preventing players from playing a development card they bought on their turn.
  6. Adding largest army (mostly Shimmy, but Aryeh will need to add some sort of indicator for the player that has it).
  7. Changing Edges to store adjacent Edges. Shimmy will add methods to interact with this in Edge, and Aryeh will cause the Board constructor to do this.
  8. Adding largest road (same work division as Largest Army).
